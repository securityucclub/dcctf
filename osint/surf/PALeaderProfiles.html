        My friend Thomas keeps talking about this Colour Science thingy in Github or something. 
        Everytime he talks to me he says "Quite keen on hearing your thoughts about that". 
        He's been talking about this since March back in 2016. Seems like he told me this over 258 times. 
        Anyways, let's get back to our homework on Python I guess. Michael said "Looks good!" 
        and we just have to replace the code that's something like XX_OOOO_XXXX and add his DCCTF{ } 
        bracket things around it. Where's the real code tho?
